# CS 233 Data Structures & Algorithms
- Implements a graph data structure using an adjacency list 
- Finds all shortest paths from starting node 1 and 14 using Dijkstras algorithm.

## Assignment Info
Implement and test your Graph ADT 

Must also implement Dijkstra's algorithm

Use this Graph listed in the pdf listed below for your data.  It has two paths that you need to compute the shortest paths for.  Print out the path taken and the the distance for each of the shortest paths requested.  

Path Example for 1 to 37:  1->8->.....->37    Distance: 79    Note: these values are not accurate. 
You path doesn't have to look exactly like this but should contain this information.

For four points of extra credit, also give the paths and distance to all the nodes from the starting nodes (starting from 1 and also in a separate calculation starting from 14).
